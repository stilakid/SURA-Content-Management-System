# SURA-Content-Management-System
This is an ongoing project where I am designing a content management system for Stanford Undergraduate Research Association. This project has been both loads of fun and a massive pain in the ass. Still, I don't regret working on it.

This project is almost complete for a preliminary deployment. Most of the buttons work and the features are packed as well. Moving forward, I need to make the website compatible with different viewing ports, creat a few more core HTML documents, add a secondary nav bar, and work on design. Also, support for embedding video sounds fun, and I want to be able to write multiple paragraphs in the same text box in a section/article. Maybe, make the nav table scrollable as well for smaller viewing port.

Later updates will include the ability to change background color, image, and transparency, size and border of photos, move sections up or down, make dialog box reset when the user clicks outside of it or maybe make the rest of the page unresponsive when the dialog box is displayed so that only if we click the cancel button can we exit that view, and implement a system backup. It will be fun!!

To check out the website, just run the command "npm start" in the terminal from the New Website folder, which is the root folder of this project.
Then, connect to http://localhost:1930/ :)

I expect to finish this project by mid May and I'll upload regular updates until completion.

NOTE: default-page.html is the page I use to test and add features, so if there is an update, that is the page to check first. The features there will be gradually added to the rest of the pages.
