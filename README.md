# SURA-Content-Management-System
This is an ongoing project where I am designing a website for Stanford Undergraduate Research Association. Since I won't be around all the time, I decided to create a custom content management system for them as well.

As you can tell, this is still work in progress. A lot of buttons don't do anything right now and the pages haven't been linked to each other. I have not yet set up the server side of things so for now, so I'd recommend setting up a local host from visual studio code to check it out.

I expect to finish this project by mid March and I'll upload regular updates until completion.
