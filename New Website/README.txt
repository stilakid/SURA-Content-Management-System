CS193X Final Project
====================

Project Name: SURA Website redesign
Your Name: Juben Rana
Your SUNetID: stilakid

Overview
--------
<TODO: A short description of your project and what it does.>
My final project for CS193X is basically a content management system. This is actually going to be used by SURA (Stanford Undergraduate Research Association) as they hired me to redesign their website.

Running
-------
<TODO: In general, we should be able to `npm install` and `npm start` your project. If there is anything else we need to know about running your pojrect, please let us know here.>

Not really. The only thing is that we need a collection in the database called webpages.

However, there is one thing I need to bring to attention. To access newly created webpages, you will need to manually access them by typing in the file name in the address bar. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the time to link them back to the index page, although that shouldn't be too difficult. I prioritized finishing other functionalities.

Features
--------
<TODO: This doesn't have to be a comprehensive list. But if there's anything we should definitely try or might miss, this is a good place to let us know about that.>

Currently, we have the following features:
 - Designed the home page, login page, and treeSearch page.
 - Can create new webpages, add content to them, and save them.
 - There are 10 templates that a user can choose to add content to the webpage.
 - Add links.

The scope of the project was a bit too large so I haven't implemented some important features:
 - Google authentication
 - Deleting webpages
 - Accessing new webpages from homepage.
 - Adding images

So, for now, if you create a new webpage, the only way to access them is to enter the name in the url bar manually.

Collaboration and libraries
---------------------------
<TODO: Identify any sources you have consulted or libraries/external code you used. If your project overlaps with coursework for another class, please describe the overlap and the parts specific to 193X here.>

As far as libraries are concerned, apart from the ones we used for assignments, I used the file system module.

Anything else?
-------------
<TODO: Anything else you'd like the teaching staff to know? How was the course overall?>

The project was initially supposed to be a simple redesign project and creating the content management system was not the plan. However, to meet the demands of my client, I had to dive much deeper. So, the end result is that the project as a whole is not finished yet (I will continue working on it throughout March. Feel free to follow my progress on GitHub: https://github.com/stilakid/SURA-Content-Management-System.git) but the current state of the project fulfills all the requirements for the final project. :)

Thank you so much for such a wonderful quarter! Although it was frustrating at times to find my way in backend development, I came out of all the challenges learning A LOT and I thoroughly enjoyed that experience!

Have a wonderful spring break!
